# BallOfTruth
I had this task already on Yalantis but I got reject last time. 
Last time i used SwiftUI, but this time i switched to UIKit, with simple MVC pattern. 
Settings and Ball Screen i connected with TabBarController. 
Main Screen with ball reacts on shakes and after 1.5 seconds after shake shows text from json. In case of internet absence and if shake was canceled shows hardcoded text.  
In Settings user can change some hardcoded phrases that saves in UserDefaults
